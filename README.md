The `gfwr` R package is a simple wrapper for the Global Fishing Watch
(GFW) APIs. It provides convenient functions to pull GFW data directly
into R in tidy formats.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gfwr like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("GlobalFishingWatch/gfwr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(gfwr)
## basic example code
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
