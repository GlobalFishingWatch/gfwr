The `gfwr` R package is a simple wrapper for the Global Fishing Watch
(GFW) [APIs](). It provides convenient functions to pull GFW data
directly into R in tidy formats.

The package currently works with the following APIs:

-   Vessel API: vessel search and identity based on AIS self reported
    data
-   Events API: encounters, loitering, port visits and fishing events
    based on AIS data
-   Map Visualization (4Wings API): apparent fishing effort based on AIS
    data

## Installation

You can install the development version of gfwr like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("GlobalFishingWatch/gfwr")
```

## Authorization

The use of `gfwr` requires a GFW API token, which users can request from
the [GFW API Portal](). Save this token to your `.Renviron` file as a
string called `"GFW_TOKEN"`. Then use `Sys.getenv("GFW_TOKEN")` and save
the information in an object in your R workspace every time you need to
extract the token and pass it to subsequent `gfwr` functions.

So you can do:

``` r
key <- Sys.getenv("GFW_TOKEN")
```

## Vessels API

The `get_vessel_info` function allows you to get vessel identity
details. There are three search types: `basic`, `advanced`, and `id`.

-   `basic` search takes features like MMSI, IMO, callsign, shipname as
    inputs and identifies all vessels in the specified dataset that
    match
-   `advanced` search allows for the use of fuzzy matching with terms
    such as LIKE. The `id` search allows the user to search using a GFW
    vessel
-   `id` allows the user to specify the `vessel id` (generated by GFW)

The user can also specify which identity databases to use:
`carrier_vessel`, `support_vessel`, `fishing_vessel`, or `all`. With the
latter, all databases are used for the search. This is generally
recommended and is the option set by default.

### Examples

To get information of a vessel with MMSI = 224224000:

``` r
get_vessel_info(query = 224224000, search_type = "basic")
```

To combine different fields and do fuzzy matching:

``` r
get_vessel_info(query = "shipname LIKE '%GABU REEFE%' OR imo = '8300949'", 
                search_type = "advanced")
```

To specify a `vessel id`:

``` r
get_vessel_info(query = "8c7304226-6c71-edbe-0b63-c246734b3c01", 
                search_type = "id")
```
