> **Important**  
> This version of gfwr gives access to Global Fishing Watch API [version 3](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#version-3-api). Starting April 30th, 2024, this is the official API version. To install gfwr 1.0, the previous version that communicated with API [version 2](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#version-2-api), please refer to branch `APIv2` in this repository. 
> `remotes::install_github("GlobalFishingWatch/gfwr", ref = "APIv2")`

The `gfwr` R package is a simple wrapper for the Global Fishing Watch (GFW) [APIs](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#introduction). It provides convenient functions to freely pull GFW data directly into R in tidy formats.

The package currently works with the following APIs:

* [Vessels API](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#vessels-api): vessel search and identity based on AIS self reported data
* [Events API](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#events-api): encounters, loitering, port visits and fishing events based on AIS data
* [Map Visualization (4Wings API)](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#map-visualization-4wings-api): apparent fishing effort based on AIS data


> **Note**:
> See the [Terms of Use](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#reference-data) page for GFW APIs for information on our API licenses and rate limits.

## Installation

You can install the most recent version of `gfwr` using:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Check/install remotes
if (!require("remotes"))
  install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("GlobalFishingWatch/gfwr")
```

`gfwr` is also in rOpenSci [R-universe](https://globalfishingwatch.r-universe.dev/gfwr#), and can be installed like this: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("gfwr", 
                 repos = c("https://globalfishingwatch.r-universe.dev",
                           "https://cran.r-project.org"))
```

Once everything is installed, you can load and use `gfwr`
in your scripts with `library(gfwr)`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(gfwr)
```

```{r load_all, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
```

## Authorization

The use of `gfwr` requires a GFW API token, which users can request from
the [GFW API Portal](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/tokens). Save
this token to your `.Renviron` file using `usethis::edit_r_environ()` and adding
a variable named `GFW_TOKEN` to the file (`GFW_TOKEN="PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"`).
Save the `.Renviron` file and restart the R session to make the edit effective.

Then use the `gfw_auth()` helper function to save the information to an object
in your R workspace every time you need to extract the token and pass it
to subsequent `gfwr` functions.

So you can do:

```{r auth, eval = TRUE}
key <- gfw_auth()
```

or this

```{r sys_getenv, eval = F}
key <- Sys.getenv("GFW_TOKEN")
```

> **Note**:
> `gfwr` functions are set to use `key = gfw_auth()` by default.

## Vessels API

The `get_vessel_info()` function allows you to get vessel identity details from
the [GFW Vessels API](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#introduction-vessels-api).

There are two search types: `search`, and `id`.

* `search` is performed by using parameters `query` for basic searches and
`where` for advanced searchers using SQL expressions
  + `query` takes a single identifier that can be the MMSI, IMO, callsign, or
  shipname as input and identifies all vessels that match.
  + `where` search allows for the use of complex search with logical clauses (AND, OR) and fuzzy matching with terms such as LIKE, using SQL syntax (see examples in the function) 
  + `includes` adds information from public registries. Options are "MATCH_CRITERIA",
  "OWNERSHIP" and "AUTHORIZATIONS"

### Examples

To get information of a vessel using its MMSI, IMO number, callsign or name, the search can be done directly using the number or the string. For example, to look for a vessel with `MMSI = 224224000`:

```{r example_vessel_info_1, eval = TRUE}
get_vessel_info(query = 224224000,
                search_type = "search",
                key = key)
```

To do more specific searches (`imo = '8300949'`), combine different fields (`imo = '8300949' AND ssvid = '214182732'`) and do fuzzy matching (`"shipname LIKE '%GABU REEFE%' OR imo = '8300949'"`), use parameter `where` instead of `query`:

```{r example_vessel_info_2, eval = TRUE}
get_vessel_info(where = "shipname LIKE '%GABU REEFE%' OR imo = '8300949'",
                search_type = "search",
                key = key)
```

* The `id` search allows the user to specify a vector of `vessel id`

> **Note**:
> `vessel id` is an internal ID generated by GFW to connect data accross APIs
and involves a combination of vessel and tracking data information. It can be
retrieved using `get_vessel_info()` as shown above.


To search using `vessel id`:

```{r example_vessel_info_3, eval = TRUE}
get_vessel_info(ids = "8c7304226-6c71-edbe-0b63-c246734b3c01",
                search_type = "id",
                key = key)
```

To specify more than one `vessel id`, you can submit a vector of identifiers:

```{r example_vessel_info_4, eval = TRUE}
get_vessel_info(ids = c("8c7304226-6c71-edbe-0b63-c246734b3c01",
                        "6583c51e3-3626-5638-866a-f47c3bc7ef7c",
                        "71e7da672-2451-17da-b239-857831602eca"),
                search_type = 'id',
                key = key)
```

Check the function documentation for examples about the other argument options.

## Events API

The `get_event()` function allows you to get data on specific vessel activities 
from the [GFW Events API](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#events-api).
Event types include apparent fishing events, potential transshipment events 
(two-vessel encounters and loitering by refrigerated carrier vessels), port 
visits, and AIS-disabling events ("gaps").
Find more information in our [caveat documentation](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#data-caveat).

### Examples

The Events API uses `vesselId` as input, so you always need to use `get_vessel_info()` first to extract `vesselId` from the `$selfReportedInfo` data and then use
it in the `get_event()` function. 


```{r example_id_event, eval = TRUE}
vessel_info <- get_vessel_info(query = 224224000, key = key)

id <- vessel_info$selfReportedInfo$id[1]
```

To get a list of port visits for that vessel:

```{r example_event_type_1, eval = TRUE}
get_event(event_type = 'PORT_VISIT',
          vessels = id,
          confidences = 4,
          key = key
          )
```

We can also use more than one `vessel id`:

```{r example_event_type_2, , eval = TRUE}
get_event(event_type = 'PORT_VISIT',
          vessels = c('8c7304226-6c71-edbe-0b63-c246734b3c01', '6583c51e3-3626-5638-866a-f47c3bc7ef7c'),
          confidences = 4,
          start_date = "2020-01-01",
          end_date = "2020-02-01",
          key = key
          )
```

Or get encounters for all vessels in a given date range:

```{r example_event_type_3, eval = TRUE}
get_event(event_type = 'ENCOUNTER',
          start_date = "2020-01-01",
          end_date = "2020-01-02",
          key = key
          )
```

When a date range is provided to `get_event()` using both `start_date` and `end_date`, any event overlapping that range will be returned, including events that start prior to `start_date` or end after `end_date`. If just `start_date` or `end_date` are provided, results will include all events that end after `start_date` or begin prior to `end_date`, respectively.

> **Note**:  
> Because encounter events are events between two vessels, a single event will be represented twice in the data, once for each vessel. To capture this information and link the related data rows, the `id` field for encounter events includes an additional suffix (1 or 2) separated by a period. The `vessel` field will also contain different information specific to each vessel.


As another example, let's combine the Vessels and Events APIs to get fishing events for a list of 20 USA-flagged trawlers:

```{r example_event_type_4a}
# Download the list of USA trawlers
usa_trawlers <- get_vessel_info(
  where = "flag='USA' AND geartypes='TRAWLERS'",
  search_type = "search",
  key = key
)
# Pass the vector of vessel ids to Events API
usa_trawler_ids <- usa_trawlers$selfReportedInfo$id[1:20]
```
> *Note*: `get_event()` can receive up to 20 vessel ids at a time 

Now get the list of fishing events for these trawlers in January, 2020:

```{r example_event_type_4b, eval=T}
get_event(event_type = 'FISHING',
          vessels = usa_trawler_ids,
          start_date = "2020-01-01",
          end_date = "2020-02-01",
          key = key
          )
```

When no events are available, the `get_event()` function returns nothing.

```{r example_event_type_4c, eval=T}
get_event(event_type = 'FISHING',
          vessels = usa_trawler_ids[2],
          start_date = "2020-01-01",
          end_date = "2020-01-01",
          key = key
          )
```


## Fishing effort API

The `get_raster()` function gets a raster from the [4Wings API](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#map-visualization-4wings-api)
and converts the response to a data frame. In order to use it, you should specify:

* The spatial resolution, which can be `LOW` (0.1 degree) or `HIGH` (0.01 degree)
* The temporal resolution, which can be `HOURLY`, `DAILY`, `MONTHLY`, `YEARLY` or `ENTIRE`.
* The variable to group by: `FLAG`, `GEARTYPE`, `FLAGANDGEARTYPE`, `MMSI` or `VESSEL_ID`
* The date range `note: this must be 366 days or less`
* The region polygon in `sf` format or the region code (such as an EEZ code) to filter the raster
* The source for the specified region. Currently, `EEZ`, `MPA`, `RFMO` or `USER_JSON` (for `sf` shapefiles).


### Examples


```{r example_map_1}
data("test_shape")
get_raster(
  spatial_resolution = 'LOW',
  temporal_resolution = 'YEARLY',
  group_by = 'FLAG',
  date_range = '2021-01-01,2021-12-31',
  region = test_shape,
  region_source = 'USER_JSON',
  key = key
  )
```

If you want raster data from a particular EEZ, you can use the `get_region_id()`
function to get the EEZ id, enter that code in the `region` argument
of `get_raster()` instead of the region shapefile (ensuring you specify the `region_source`
as `'EEZ'`:

```{r example_map_2, eval= TRUE}
# use EEZ function to get EEZ code of Cote d'Ivoire
code_eez <- get_region_id(region_name = 'CIV', region_source = 'EEZ', key = key)

get_raster(spatial_resolution = 'LOW',
           temporal_resolution = 'YEARLY',
           group_by = 'FLAG',
           start_date = "2021-01-01",
           end_date = "2021-10-01",
           region = code_eez$id,
           region_source = 'EEZ',
           key = key)
```

You could search for just one word in the name of the EEZ and then decide which
one you want:

```{r example_map_3, eval = TRUE}
(get_region_id(region_name = 'France', region_source = 'EEZ', key = key))

```


Let's say we're interested in the French Exclusive Economic Zone, 5677

```{r fr_eez, eval = TRUE}
get_raster(spatial_resolution = 'LOW',
           temporal_resolution = 'YEARLY',
           group_by = 'FLAG',
           start_date = "2021-01-01",
           end_date = "2021-10-01",
           region = 5677,
           region_source = 'EEZ',
           key = key)
```


A similar approach can be used to search for a specific Marine Protected Area,
in this case the Phoenix Island Protected Area (PIPA)

```{r example_map_4, eval= TRUE}
# use region id function to get MPA code of Phoenix Island Protected Area
code_mpa <- get_region_id(region_name = 'Phoenix', region_source = 'MPA', key = key)

get_raster(spatial_resolution = 'LOW',
           temporal_resolution = 'YEARLY',
           group_by = 'FLAG',
           start_date = "2015-01-01",
           end_date = "2015-06-01",
           region = code_mpa$id[1],
           region_source = 'MPA',
           key = key)
```

It is also possible to filter rasters to one of the five regional fisheries management
organizations (RFMO) that manage tuna and tuna-like species. These include `"ICCAT"`,
`"IATTC"`,`"IOTC"`, `"CCSBT"` and `"WCPFC"`.

```{r example_map_5, eval=T}
get_raster(spatial_resolution = 'LOW',
           temporal_resolution = 'DAILY',
           group_by = 'FLAG',
           start_date = "2021-01-01",
           end_date = "2021-01-15",
           region = 'ICCAT',
           region_source = 'RFMO',
           key = key)
```

The `get_region_id()` function also works in reverse. If a region id is passed as
a `numeric` to the function as the `region_name`, the corresponding region label
or iso3 can be returned. This is especially useful when events are returned with
regions.

```{r example_region_id}
# using same example as above
get_event(event_type = 'FISHING',
          vessels = usa_trawler_ids,
          start_date = "2020-01-01",
          end_date = "2020-02-01",
          key = key
          ) %>%
  # extract EEZ id code
  dplyr::mutate(eez = as.character(purrr::map(purrr::map(regions, purrr::pluck, 'eez'),
                                              paste0, collapse = ','))) %>%
  dplyr::select(id, type, start, end, lat, lon, eez) %>%
  dplyr::rowwise() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(eez_name = get_region_id(region_name = as.numeric(eez),
                                         region_source = 'EEZ',
                                         key = key)$label) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-start, -end)
```
