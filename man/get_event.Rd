\arguments{
\item{event_type}{Type of event to get data of. A vector with any combination
of "ENCOUNTER", "FISHING", "GAP", "LOITERING", "PORT_VISIT"}

\item{start_date}{Start of date range to search events, in YYYY-MM-DD format
and including this date}

\item{end_date}{End of date range to search events, in YYYY-MM-DD format and
excluding this date}

\item{sort}{How to sort the events. By default, +start, which sorts the events
in ascending order (+) of the start dates of the events. Other possible values
are -start, +end, -end.}

\item{vessels}{A vector of \code{vesselIds}, obtained via the \code{get_vessel_info()}
function. The maximum number of \code{vesselIds} depends on the character length of
the whole request, the request will fail with error HTTP 422: Unprocessable
entity when too many \code{vesselIds} are sent. This value is around 2,800
vessels, depending on the other parameters of the request.}

\item{flags}{ISO3 code for the flag of the vessels. Null by default.}

\item{vessel_types}{A vector of vessel types, any combination of: "FISHING",
"CARRIER", "SUPPORT", "PASSENGER", "OTHER_NON_FISHING", "SEISMIC_VESSEL",
"BUNKER_OR_TANKER", "CARGO"}

\item{region_source}{Source of the region ('EEZ','MPA', 'RFMO' or
'USER_SHAPEFILE'). Null by default but required if a value for region is
specified.}

\item{region}{If \code{region_source} is set to "EEZ", "MPA" or "RFMO", GFW region
code (see \code{get_region_id()}) if \code{region_source = "USER_SHAPEFILE"}, \code{sf}
shapefile with the area of interest.}

\item{duration}{Minimum duration that the event should have (in minutes). The
default value is 1.}

\item{encounter_types}{Only useful when \code{event_type = "ENCOUNTER"}. Filters for
types of vessels during the encounter. A
vector with any combination of: "CARRIER-FISHING", "FISHING-CARRIER",
"FISHING-SUPPORT", "SUPPORT-FISHING"}

\item{gap_intentional_disabling}{Logical. Only useful when \code{event_type = "GAP"}.
Filters intentional gap events according to Global Fishing Watch algorithms.
Check the \href{https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#ais-off-event-aka-gap}{gaps API documentation} for more details.}

\item{confidences}{Only useful when \code{event_type = "PORT_VISIT"}. Confidence
levels of port visits. Low-confidence port visits (confidence 1)
are not available for download. See the
\href{https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#confidence-levels-of-a-port-visit}{API documentation}
for more details}

\item{key}{Authorization token. Can be obtained with \code{gfw_auth()} function}

\item{limit}{Amount of search results to return. The default value is 99999.}

\item{offset}{Offset into the search results, used for pagination. It starts
at 0. It is used in combination with the param limit, for example you send
limit = 5 and you get in the response total vessels =10. So, If you send
offset =0 OR you donâ€™t send it, you will get the first 5 results (first page).
Therefore, in order to get the second page, you need to send offset = 5 which
is the position of the first element you want from the second page.}

\item{quiet}{Boolean. Whether to print the number of events returned by the
request}

\item{print_request}{Boolean. Whether to print the request, for debugging
purposes. When contacting the GFW team it will be useful to send this string}

\item{...}{Other arguments}
}
\description{
Base function to get events from API and convert response to data frame
}
\details{
There are currently four available event types and these events are provided
for three vessel types - fishing, carrier, and support vessels.
Fishing events (\code{event_type = "FISHING"}) are specific to fishing vessels and
loitering events (\code{event_type = "LOITERING"}) are specific to carrier vessels.
Port visits (\code{event_type = "PORT_VISIT"}) and encounters
(\code{event_type = "ENCOUNTER"}) are available for all vessel types. For more
details about the various event types, see the
\href{https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#data-caveat}{GFW API documentation}.

Encounter events involve multiple vessels and one row is returned for each
vessel involved in an encounter.
For example, an encounter between a carrier and fishing vessel
(\code{CARRIER-FISHING}) will have one row for the fishing vessel and one for the
carrier vessel. The \code{id} field for encounter events has two components
separated by a \code{.}. The first component is the unique id for the encounter
event and will be the same for all vessels involved in the encounter. The
second component is an integer used to distinguish between different vessels
in the encounter.
