See documentation gfw_ais_fishing_hours() GFW APIs info parameter options. case, let’s request data time range 100th degree resolution grouped flag State: data includes fishing flag states, make map activity, first need summarize activity grid cell. Now can use ggplot2 plot data.  another example, let’s request low resolution apparent fishing effort data within jurisdiction Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), grouped yearly gear type: time, instead aggregating activity, let’s plot activity specific gear type:","code":"eez_regions <- gfw_regions(region_source = 'EEZ') eez_regions #> # A tibble: 285 × 5 #>    iso   label                          id GEONAME                      POL_TYPE #>    <chr> <chr>                       <dbl> <chr>                        <chr>    #>  1 ASM   American Samoa               8444 United States Exclusive Eco… 200NM    #>  2 SHN   Ascension                    8379 British Exclusive Economic … 200NM    #>  3 COK   Cook Islands                 8446 New Zealand Exclusive Econo… 200NM    #>  4 FLK   Falkland / Malvinas Islands  8389 Overlapping claim Falkland … Overlap… #>  5 PYF   French Polynesia             8440 French Exclusive Economic Z… 200NM    #>  6 PCN   Pitcairn                     8439 British Exclusive Economic … 200NM    #>  7 SHN   Saint Helena                 8380 British Exclusive Economic … 200NM    #>  8 WSM   Samoa                        8445 Samoan Exclusive Economic Z… 200NM    #>  9 TON   Tonga                        8448 Tongan Exclusive Economic Z… 200NM    #> 10 SHN   Tristan da Cunha             8382 British Exclusive Economic … 200NM    #> # ℹ 275 more rows # Use gfw_region_id function to get EEZ code for Italy ita_eez_code <- gfw_region_id(region = \"ITA\", region_source = \"EEZ\") #> # A tibble: 1 × 5 #>   iso3  label    id GEONAME                         POL_TYPE #>   <chr> <chr> <dbl> <chr>                           <chr>    #> 1 ITA   Italy  5682 Italian Exclusive Economic Zone 200NM # Download data for the Italian EEZ eez_fish_df <- gfw_ais_fishing_hours(   spatial_resolution = \"HIGH\",   temporal_resolution = \"YEARLY\",   group_by = \"FLAG\",   start_date = start_date,   end_date = end_date,   region = ita_eez_code$id,   region_source = \"EEZ\"   ) #> # A tibble: 69,557 × 6 #>      Lat   Lon `Time Range` flag  `Vessel IDs` `Apparent Fishing Hours` #>    <dbl> <dbl>        <dbl> <chr>        <dbl>                    <dbl> #>  1  44.1  13.0         2021 ITA              5                     7.05 #>  2  43.3  14.1         2021 ITA              1                     2.17 #>  3  39.8  16.7         2021 ITA              2                     1.62 #>  4  41.8  16.7         2021 ITA              1                     0.8  #>  5  44.4  13.0         2021 ITA              1                     1.2  #>  6  42.3  14.8         2021 ITA              5                    15.0  #>  7  41.6  16.4         2021 ITA              4                    10.6  #>  8  42.5  15.2         2021 ITA             10                    11.8  #>  9  43.8  14.0         2021 ITA              1                     2.33 #> 10  38.4  15.7         2021 ITA              1                     4.89 #> # ℹ 69,547 more rows eez_fish_all_df <- eez_fish_df %>%    group_by(Lat, Lon) %>%    summarize(fishing_hours = sum(`Apparent Fishing Hours`, na.rm = T)) #> `summarise()` has grouped output by 'Lat'.
